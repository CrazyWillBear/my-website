      <h1>Software Recommendations</h1>
      <p>
        As a fan of the open source philosophy, I try to use free and open
        source projects whenever possible. Here is a list of the programs I
        recommend using, based on category of software.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-l">
      <h3>Web Browers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >Brave</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Brave is a free, semi-open-source internet browser based in Chromium.
          It is customizeable, user-friendly, and comes with a ton of useful
          features.
        </p>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box-r">
      <h3>Text Editors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >Neovim</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Neovim is free, open-source, and an improved version of the already
          amazing text editor Vim. It has more features, less bloat, and is more
          customizeable.
        </p>

        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.vim.org/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >Vim</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Vim is free, open-source, and an improved version of Vi. Vim is
          slightly more bloated than Neovim and has less features, however its
          one advantage is that Lua can be used for configuration.

      <h3>Operating Systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://artixlinux.org/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >Artix Linux</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Artix Linux is my personal favorite Linux distro. It's based on Arch
          Linux (my previous favorite). It's customizeable, fast, lightweight,
          and not overly-complicated. It's advantage over Arch is that it
          doesn't use systemd (which is old and slow).
        </p>

        <li>
          <a
            href="https://archlinux.org/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >Arch Linux</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Arch Linux is my second favorite Linux distro. It's considered a
          classic among Linux users since it's been around forever and has
          served as the base for many other Linux distros. Like Artix, it's
          customizeable, fast, lightweight, and not overly-complicated.
        </p>

        <li>
          <a
            href="https://pop.system76.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >Pop!_OS</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Pop!_OS is a beginner Linux distro based in Ubuntu, without the
          spyware. It brings all the advantages of using Linux while being just
          as easy to use as MacOS or Windows.

      <h3>Shells</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.zsh.org/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >zsh</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          zsh is super fast, its autocomplete is faster than Bash's and
          functions like a drop-down menu, it follows POSIX standards more
          closely than Bash, and is super customizeable.
        </p>

        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
            >Bash</a
          >
        </li>
        <p>
          Bash is the most widely used shell in Linux and comes installed by
          default on many UNIX systems. It gets the job done, however with
          alternatives available, it isn't necessarily my first choice.
