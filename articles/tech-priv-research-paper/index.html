This structure allows the user to learn and grow with their computer, and eventually come away with significant knowledge of the Linux terminal. On top of that, PopOS is faster and easier to install than Windows and is significantly less bloated."

      <h1>Technological Privacy Research Paper</h1>
      <p>
        For context, this was a research paper written my senior year of high
        school.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since I began diving into the world of programming and technology,
        I’ve come across many different positions regarding the ethics of
        software. Many prominent figures in the computer science community –
        including Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, and Richard Stallman,
        the creator of GNU – support open-source software. Large tech companies
        such as Meta (formerly Facebook), ByteDance (creator of TikTok), and
        Microsoft follow a very different philosophy, one focused on profit and
        expansion. Their software is proprietary – meaning their code is kept
        secret – in order to prevent so-called “intellectual property theft” and
        hide tracking software that if fully exposed would
        <i>certainly</i> alienate their respective user bases. This tracking of
        user data is a standard practice among large tech companies, even as
        some such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft have begun open-sourcing many
        pieces of their software. I am learning about technological privacy
        because I want to find out the extent to which internet users are being
        taken advantage of by large tech companies to help my reader(s)
        understand how and why to protect their personal data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Privacy and Tech Companies</h3>
      <p>
        Large tech companies often monetize their software by charging a usage
        fee and/or collecting and selling data for advertising purposes.
        Tracking user data for marketing purposes isn’t a recent phenomenon.
        Before the internet, shop owners might watch to see what items people
        buy or how much money they spend. Since the information is collected in
        the aggregate and no personal information is recorded, the customers
        remain anonymous and thus are comfortable with said collection of
        information. Online, however, “No longer are [customer] shopping
        behaviors available only in the aggregate. Instead, individuals are
        tracked, and information is collected from purchasing transactions as
        they surf through Web sites” (Caudill, Murphy). The anonymity has been
        removed from the process, and with it the bare minimum privacy we should
        expect when it comes to technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        As time has progressed, the extent to which large companies collect data
        on their users has become increasingly worrying. TikTok, the popular
        social media app, began collecting biometric data such as faceprints and
        fingerprints in 2021 (McCluskey). Since TikTok’s privacy policy is very
        vague, its intentions are impossible to decipher. At worst, some worry
        that TikTok may use such data for “‘...mass re-identification and
        surveillance,’” (McCluskey). The potential for malpractice when it comes
        to the handling of user data is ever-increasing, and as discussed
        earlier, is already bad enough.
        <br />
        <br />
        TikTok is not alone in its questionable pursuit of data. As Android has
        become more accessible to developers, “certain apps have crossed the
        line from merely displaying ads to pushing (or forcing) products to the
        user, harvesting private data for future use (e.g. spam or other use),
        and even extracting fraudulent revenues” (Erturk). This trend is so
        unwavering that some experts predict that a separate market for privacy
        will emerge (Rust, et al), allowing consumers to purchase certain
        degrees of privacy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Ethics and Technological Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        The ethics behind technological privacy are more complicated as they
        differ between cultures. These differences are highlighted in the
        different approaches governments take to regulating user data
        collection. The United States’s “privacy laws… [are] rooted in a
        ‘harms-prevention-based’ hodgepodge of privacy protections”, whereas the
        European Union has taken a “broader ‘rights-based’ approach” (Bellamy).
        Although ethical interpretations of current privacy issues differ among
        people, there are repeating ideas and themes. For example, privacy
        itself is considered valuable by most people, however, the extent to
        which that privacy should be protected is up for debate.
        <br />
        <br />
        Regardless of the approach you take as discussed above, there are
        reasons to improve privacy and security that satisfies most of said
        approaches. The simplest to consider is the question of “What could go
        wrong?”, or more specifically, “What could the company do with my
        data?”. Using TikTok as a continued example, “[TikTok] agreed to pay $92
        million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that it violated
        Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act, the federal Video Privacy
        Protection Act, and other consumer and privacy protection laws”
        (McCluskey). Even with laws barring their actions, large corporations
        have used and collected user data with malicious (or at least not noble)
        intent. Given that there’s a demonstrably non-zero probability of large
        tech companies using data unethically (when viewed through most ethical
        lenses), it’s better to take a stricter approach to deal with these
        companies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>The Open Source Movement</h3>
      <p>
        Recently within the computer science community and technology scene in
        general there has been a sort of open-source movement. Many companies
        like Apple and Microsoft have open-sourced some or all of their software
        in order to promote software quality and prove that no data collection
        is occurring. In the same vein, Linux – the most popular fully open
        source operating system kernel – has become more popular over the last
        few years, its market share having increased ~.7% since January 2022 to
        2.91% of desktops (“Largest Tech Companies by Market Cap”). Its appeal
        is easy to understand, given that it’s very secure. Like with other
        “open source application teams… [Linux is] able to fix flaws much faster
        than both internally developed and commercial application teams” because
        “open-source operating systems allow and encourage more people to work
        against malware” (Erturk). The growing popularity of an operating system
        famous for its privacy and security is indicative of the cultural shift
        taking place in the world of technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        With large tech companies competing directly with open-source projects
        providing high-quality and privacy-oriented software, we are likely to
        see large tech companies open-sourcing more of their software as people
        turn towards established open-source projects as alternatives to more
        invasive yet popular software. This would reveal the full extent to
        which these companies are tracking their users and likely result in
        either alienation or different data collection practices.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Why Large Tech Companies Collect Data</h3>
      <p>
        As discussed earlier, large tech companies often monetize their software
        by charging a usage fee and/or collecting and selling data for
        advertising purposes. For the most part, the latter appears to be more
        popular and successful. Google and Meta – both of whom are in the top 8
        largest tech companies by market cap – make the majority of their money
        selling data from their free services (Google’s selection of free
        software includes YouTube, Google Drive/Docs/Slides/Sheets/etc, Google
        itself, Android, Gmail, and <i>many</i> others while Meta’s selection of
        free software includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others).
        <br />
        <br />
        According to Meta itself, they track and sell data in order to “provide,
        improve and develop [our] services”. Most large tech companies claim
        that data collection is used to improve their software using
        user-generated metrics and make patching flaws easier by monitoring
        usage and tracking errors as they progress. The money acquired via
        selling the data for marketing purposes is then used to fund the
        development of the software and grow the company. None of this is
        dependent on data collection, however. As we’ve discussed earlier,
        open-source projects (most of which do not collect user data) are more
        secure and of higher quality than proprietary software because of direct
        community involvement and more people contributing to the source code.
        If large companies were to open source their projects and start charging
        usage fees or use non-targeted advertising, they would still make a
        profit <i>and</i> have a higher quality product.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Constant and personalized data collection is unnecessary in order to
        ensure quality software. As we’ve established previously, open-source
        software is often more secure and of higher quality. Most open-source
        projects only take data from people who are willing to provide it in
        order to patch an error or improve a specific component (thus by nature
        not personalized). If tech companies were honestly trying to improve
        their software, they’d only collect it during an error or with explicit
        permission. The biggest reason that large tech companies collect data is
        to turn a profit by selling it for marketing purposes. Even then,
        non-personalized advertising is still profitable and used by some tech
        companies like DuckDuckGo.
        <br />
        <br />
        Given that data collection is unnecessary to create quality software and
        not fully necessary to generate revenue, we must then ask ourselves what
        else are these companies doing with our data. As discussed earlier, the
        worst-case scenario is quite bad and the reality isn’t much better (at
        least with TikTok). At worst, identification and subsequent surveillance
        could lend power to dangerous people and governments. In reality,
        fraudulent revenue streams and illegal and/or hyper-aggressive data
        collection have been identified in many services. These problems are
        rarely found in open-source programs, which fully expose their source
        code to gather community insight and quell fears of data collection.
        Open-source projects like Linux offer the best example of how easy and
        beneficial it is to use open-source software. Linux is faster, more
        secure, more customizable, and arguably more user-friendly than Windows
        and/or MacOS, with “96.3 percent of the top 1 million web servers…
        running Linux” (Vaughan-Nichols). The benefits of open-source extend
        past privacy and into quality, making them excellent options for
        consumers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Switching to Linux and using open-source alternatives to everything is
        possible, but for most a non-realistic answer due to the learning curve
        and inconvenience. However, completely changing your technological
        habits isn’t necessary to protect the majority of your data from being
        misused. Basic things like using Firefox with Privacy Badger and HTTPS
        Everywhere (web extensions available on your browser’s respective
        extension store), disabling cookies where you can and not idling your
        computer (letting it run instead of sleeping/hibernating or shutting it
        down) are great ways to prevent as much data collection as you can
        without causing a severe inconvenience (Ryabitsev et al). By protecting
        our data and promoting open-source software, we can make technology more
        private and serve our best interests.
