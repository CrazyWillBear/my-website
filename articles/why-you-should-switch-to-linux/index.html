      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Linux is an operating system kernel used to power computers around the
        world, from PCs to internet servers. Regardless of the purpose, Linux
        seems to find a way to remain advantageous. The many distro (Linux
        distribution) choices, the open-source code, and the passionate and
        informative community all culminate in an operating system experience
        that is unrivaled.
        <br />
        <br />
        Windows users, or otherwise average consumers, are often stuck with the
        operating system that comes preinstalled on their devices. Since
        Microsoft strikes deals with computer manufacturers - which commits said
        manufacturers to preinstall Windows on the computers they produce - the
        average consumer is oftentimes exposed to Windows as their first
        operating system. Once someone becomes familiar with an operating
        system, it becomes difficult for them to switch and “relearn” how to use
        their computer(s). As a result, consumers often view switching operating
        systems as an inconvenience and not worthwhile.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, if one were to look further into the subject, the benefits
        become clear. The speed of Linux combined with its customizability
        provides for a convenient experience with performance far beyond
        Windows’. However, most importantly, Linux allows the user to actually
        own and control their computer. For example, Windows machines come with
        software that is pre-installed and sometimes irremovable such as Edge,
        Mail, Groove Music, Sticky Notes, Voice Recorder, Paint 3D, and even
        Candy Crush (no joke). On the vast majority of Linux distros, you choose
        what is installed and what isn’t. Even on distros that have
        pre-installed software, the uninstallation of said software is as simple
        as one command.
      </p>

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>The Linux Terminal</h3>
      <p>
        Switching to Linux is often viewed as a scary and threatening task,
        mostly due to the emphasis on the terminal. For context, the terminal is
        the Linux equivalent of command prompt or PowerShell (in reality they
        are not even comparable, but this is the best example I can think of).
        The emphasis on the terminal is powerful, as almost every Linux distro
        essentially requires that you have at least a basic understanding of the
        terminal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although the necessity of the terminal differs from distro to distro,
        many beginner distros require less knowledge of the terminal (such as
        Ubuntu or PopOS). On said distros, there are tools in place to avoid the
        usage of the terminal completely. Installing apps can be done using the
        PopShop or .deb installers, and exploring files can be done using
        pre-installed file explorers. This user-friendly style allows new Linux
        users to gradually become familiar with the terminal while using
        graphical tools that are familiar and intuitive.

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Spyware</h3>
      <p>
        The main reason that consumers should switch to Linux, is the endless
        tracking on the part of Microsoft (Apple and their operating system
        macOS are also big offenders). There have been many instances of
        Microsoft being exposed for having implemented spyware in Windows. For
        example, according to the InstallGentoo Wiki (<a
          href="https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Windows_10#External_links"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >https://wiki.installgentoo.com</a
        >), “It was revealed that Microsoft sends encrypted images of the user's
        desktop back to [their headquarters].” To demonstrate the extent of the
        spying, The Hacker News (<a
          href="https://thehackernews.com/2016/02/microsoft-windows10-privacy.html"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >https://thehackernews.com</a
        >) did an experiment where they tracked their network activity on
        Windows to see what data was being sent where. “[The] idle Windows 10
        box[system] had tried over 5,500 connections to 93 different IP
        addresses, out of which almost 4,000 were made to 51 different IP
        addresses belonging to Microsoft.” In other words, the Windows computer,
        sitting alone and not being used, connected roughly 4,000 times to
        Microsoft’s servers. And this spying isn’t only limited to Microsoft, as
        the way the spying took place was less than secure. “Windows 10 expanded
        that connection to 113 non-private IP addresses, potentially allowing
        hackers to intercept this data.” [their italics].
        <br />
        <br />
        Why should you care about Microsoft tracking you? Your computer is
        personal and contains private property. Allowing companies to access the
        data stored on your computer (which is private property) without your
        knowledge is plenty of reason to care. To draw a comparison, you
        wouldn’t like it if a car manufacturer sold you a car, then proceeded to
        constantly monitor where you traveled with it and who or what you
        traveled with. Why should that same ideology not apply to your computer?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>The Importance of Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        And if you think you couldn’t care less about people knowing what’s on
        your computer, I urge you to think twice. You are most likely storing
        valuable data on your computer(s) (such as financial information,
        private diaries or records, medical information, work resources, etc).
        These large companies are often perceived as faceless, but it’s
        important to understand that strangers have access to your private data,
        people that you might not want to see it. Your property is on that
        computer, and it shouldn’t be turned over or exposed to random
        strangers. Furthermore, these companies use the data they collect to
        exploit users for money and power. Giving tech companies the power they
        desire is a terrible idea, and society as well as individual people are
        already facing the consequences (think of Facebook spreading conspiracy
        theories and/or Google selling your personal information).
        <br />
        <br />
        On Linux, it is extremely rare for distros or companies to track your
        activity or spy on you. Since Linux is open source as well as the vast
        majority of its distros, spyware is easily snuffed out and often exposed
        publicly so you don’t have to worry. Even distros and software that have
        telemetry are often doing so only with the consent of the user (like
        Ubuntu, which has opt-in telemetry).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Price</h3>
      <p>
        Besides all the technical benefits of using Linux, there are economic
        incentives as well. The Linux kernel itself is open source and thus free
        to use. As a result, the vast majority of Linux distros are free or have
        optional pricing. This starkly contrasts with Windows, which costs
        upwards of $130. macOS is in a similar situation, where using the
        operating system is only allowed on Apple computers which are
        notoriously expensive (although in theory, you can install macOS onto
        any computer using various techniques). Besides the cost of the
        operating system itself, due to the Linux community’s emphasis on free
        software, there are many alternatives to expensive software available on
        Linux that cost nothing to install and use. Overall, using Linux turns
        out to be much cheaper than Windows or macOS.
      </p>

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        If there is one thing you should take away from this, it’s that Linux
        distros are, in general, better than Windows. Better of course in this
        context means more privacy, security, performance, and customizability,
        but with less bloated and unnecessary software. Making the switch can
        feel risky and inconvenient, but I assure you that beyond the initial
        switch comes all the benefits of using Linux over Windows.
        <br />
        <br />
        I urge everyone who uses Windows to think more deeply than “It’s a lot
        to learn” or “I don’t care if they track me”. Do you really think that,
        or are you making excuses so you can in good conscience avoid the
        inconvenient switch? All I ask is that you research more and think
        deeper about your values and priorities.
