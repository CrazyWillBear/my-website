      content="First of all, choose a beginner distro. I recommend PopOS, it is a fork of Ubuntu with the telemetry (spyware) removed and other unnecessary tools removed or improved. It allows users to do all necessary tasks without the terminal but requires the user to learn how to use the terminal to perform more complex tasks. This structure allows the user to learn and grow with their computer, and eventually come away with significant knowledge of the Linux terminal. On top of that, PopOS is faster and easier to install than Windows and is significantly less bloated."

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">The Hypocrisy of Presidential Pardons</h3>
      <p style="margin-top: 0">By William B. Chastain  -  <time datetime="2025-01-23">01/23/2025</time></p>

      <p>
        The GOP prides itself on being the party of ‘law and order’. Their
        outspoken support for police officers and tough-on-crime policies
        underscore this idea; however, this ideal has recently come into
        question following a blanket pardon of January 6th rioters by President
        Donald Trump.
      </p>

      <p>
        President Trump’s pardon was all-encompassing. Most violent offenders,
        those who assaulted and injured Capitol Police, were included. Asked
        about how this is compatible with the GOP’s stance on law enforcement,
        House Speaker Mike Johnson beat around the bush without a clear answer,
        saying “The President’s made his decision. I don’t second-guess those”.
        This starkly contrasts with his response to former president Joe Biden’s
        last-minute pardons – which included his family, members of the January
        6th committee, and others such as Dr. Anthony Fauci to protect them from
        potentially vengeful actions by President Trump – which he called
        “shocking” and “disgusting”.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hypocrisy is staggering; the leader of a party that once claimed to
        be law enforcement’s best friend is now responsible for the release of
        hundreds of criminals guilty of assaulting police officers. Mind you,
        the vast majority of those pardoned pleaded guilty to their crimes.
        Several who were already in prison had their sentences commuted,
        including those convicted or otherwise charged with engaging in the
        separate seditious conspiracies mounted by leaders of the Proud Boys and
        Oath Keepers to thwart the lawful transfer of power. It should be noted
        that several Republicans denounced Trump’s blanket pardoning, including
        the likes of Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Senator Bill Cassidy
        of Louisiana, and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, however many remain
        silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s easy to pick on Republicans for this sort of thing, as President
        Trump is more willing to break from tradition than his recent
        predecessors. Even so, Democrats too have had their moments. Joe Biden
        presented himself as a return to normalcy, the solution to Trump’s
        alleged abuse of power and lack of integrity. Despite this and his
        promises not to do so, the former president pardoned his son Hunter
        within the final two months of his term, claiming a “miscarriage of
        justice” had taken place. Special counsel David Weiss barked back at
        Biden, saying “The President’s statements unfairly impugn the integrity…
        of Department of Justice personnel”. The pardons were related to charges
        against Hunter Biden, including lying on a gun application about his
        drug use and in a separate case, three felony tax offenses and six
        misdemeanor offenses. According to Weiss, “both cases [were] proven
        beyond a reasonable doubt” and were not politically motivated, writing
        he “prosecuted the two cases against [Hunter] Biden because he broke the
        law” in a final report. As a result, in similar fashion to Trump’s
        blanket pardons, several high-profile Democrats spoke out against Biden,
        but many more were silent or their stance ambiguous.
      </p>

      <p>
        This trend is alarming. Without their parties and voters holding them
        accountable, recent presidents have pushed the boundaries of what
        actions can be taken in line with their party’s goals. Pardoning violent
        rioters that injured roughly 140 police officers and killed five is
        certainly against the GOP’s values while lying to the populace about
        your intention to pardon your family members goes against the supposed
        integrity of the Democratic party. It’s up to us, the people, to speak
        up, to make our voices heard. Presidents can only assume power with the
        support of the people; so it’s on us to make it clear, we don’t like the
        presidential pass.
