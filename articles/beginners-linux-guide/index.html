      <h3>The Distro</h3>
      <p>
        First of all, choose a beginner distro. I recommend PopOS, it is a fork
        of Ubuntu with the telemetry (spyware) removed and other unnecessary
        tools removed or improved. It allows users to do all necessary tasks
        without the terminal but requires the user to learn how to use the
        terminal to perform more complex tasks. This structure allows the user
        to learn and grow with their computer, and eventually come away with
        significant knowledge of the Linux terminal. On top of that, PopOS is
        faster and easier to install than Windows and is significantly less
        bloated.

      <h3>Stuck?</h3>
      <p>
        When you become confused or are stuck trying to do something, reference
        the ArchWiki (<a
          href="https://wiki.archlinux.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >https://wiki.archlinux.org</a
        >), as this advice applies to the majority of Linux distros. Finally, I
        recommend that once you become comfortable with PopOS, you research
        other distros and switch to a more difficult and customizable distro. It
        will help you learn way more about Linux and allow you to customize your
        Linux install much more than on PopOS. Some other distros I recommend
        are Arch, Fedora, Debian, and if you so dare, Gentoo.
      </p>

    <div class="box-c">
      <h3>Communities</h3>
      <p>
        Most distros have their own communities as well as websites with wikis,
        which should help you on your journey. If you ever need advice, I
        recommend you ask on Reddit or Discord for help, as some privately run
        websites are known for being jerks to new Linux users (this is a
        minority of the Linux community).
